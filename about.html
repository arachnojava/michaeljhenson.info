Whence it Came:</b></td>
<td colspan="2">
<p>Mom was always good with numbers. Dad would do
anything to make a buck. Therefore, it seemed somewhat natural that
they would at least dabble in the world of small business ownership. In
the course of my growing up, my parents owned a storage warehouse, two
laundromats, and various rental properties. Typically, Dad did the
physical labor while Mom managed the books. However, they both
maintained regular, full-time jobs in addition to these businesses on
the side, so their time and attention was spread thin.</p>
<p>My uncle John (Mom's brother) also had some
personal businesses that he managed himself with the help of a personal
computer, so he persuaded Mom that her job would be significantly
easier if she had one of her own.</p>
<p>The only computer retailer in that backwater area
was Radio Shack, so we became the proud owners of a Tandy 1000 EX. Mom
set to work immediately learning how to make use of it, and she taught
me everything she was learning along the way.</p>
<p>Then one day my uncle David (Dad's brother)
stopped by for a visit. He was in high school at the time and was
learning some fundamental computer programming skills. He showed me
something utterly simple that changed my life forever. On the fly, he
wrote two simple programs using the GW-BASIC interpreter that came
packaged with our early version of MS-DOS:</p>
<p> </p>
<ul>
<li>One program that prompted the user for their
name, and then printed it a hundred times via a loop.</li>
<li>Another that contained nested loops and
arithmetic operations to produce a multiplication table.</li>
</ul>
<p></p>
<p>That was all I needed to see. From that point on,
I spent countless hours reading the BASIC reference manual and writing
programs to apply and test the things I was reading. It became a
power-mad addiction that took hold and never let go.</p>
<p>It was not long after that I started making
extremely simple games that to this day continue to evolve in
complexity. When you love what you do, you never stop learning and
doing.</p>

<p>I currently work as an associate professor at <a href="http://www.devry.edu" target="_new">DeVry
University</a>, primarily teaching game and simulation programming courses.  In addition to my teaching duties, I am also the faculty sponsor
for our local Epsilon Delta Pi chapter -- an honor society for students of computer programming.</p>
<p>Prior to the move, I taught computer science courses at <a href="http://www.motech.edu" target="_new">Missouri
Technical School</a> (2002-2008) and game design courses at <a href="http://www.sanford-brown.edu/sbc/index.asp" target="_new">Sanford-Brown
College</a> (2007-2008).</p>
<p>Most of my career before all that has been spent
doing
software development, maintenance, and support for various corporations
in the St. Louis area as I gained software development experience and
worked to support my game projects on the side.</p>

<td colspan="2" valign="top">
<p>Since I was about 14 years old, my primary hobby
has been game design and programming, to which most of this site is
dedicated.</p>
<p>I am also a musician. I played bass guitar in a
few different rock bands in high school, and I've written a number of
original compositions in the years since. Some are in the spirit of the
rock 'n roll that inspires me, and some were written for use as game
soundtracks.</p>
<p>In what little time remains, I enjoy bicycling,
bowling, yoga, parapsychology, and of course <b><i>video
games!</i></b></p>
