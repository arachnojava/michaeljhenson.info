                have instances;
                a class that has declared one or more
                methods for which it does not provide

		aspects of an entity and ignoring its accidental

<tr><td><b>algorithm</b>:  </td>
            <td>a finite sequence of unambiguous instructions which,

                a procedure for solving a problem in terms of the
                steps to be taken and the order in which the steps

		examined to understand its requirements without planning the
		implementation</td></tr>
