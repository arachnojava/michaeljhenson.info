<tr><td><b>scalability</b>:  </td>
            <td>a quality such that the scale on which a system is used can increase
                without modification to the system itself</td></tr>

<tr><td><b>scaling transparency</b>:  </td>
            <td>a type of transparency that allows the system and applications to expand
                in scale without change to the system structure or the application
                algorithms</td></tr>

<tr><td><b>scenario</b>:  </td>
            <td>a sequence of events that occur during one particular execution of a system</td></tr>

<tr><td><b>sequencer</b>:  </td>
            <td>a process to which all messages are sent before being
                multicast so that the sequencer can assign and identifier
                to each message before sending
                </td></tr>

<tr><td><b>sequential consistency</b>:  </td>
            <td>a property where memory operations appear to occur one at at
                time in the order in which they're expected to happen
                </td></tr>

<tr><td><b>serial equivalence</b>:  </td>
            <td>a property of some transactions such that concurrent
                  execution has the same effect as serial execution
                  </td></tr>

<tr><td><b>server</b>:  </td>
            <td>hardware or software that provides some kind of service to
                other hardware or software</td></tr>

<tr><td><b>service</b>:  </td>
            <td>a group of related functions that work together to provide a
                functional capability.</td></tr>

<tr><td><b>shared-memory multiprocessor</b>:  </td>
            <td>an architecture that contains several independent
                processors, each being able to execute a separate
                program</td></tr>

<tr><td><b>sheet</b>:  </td>
            <td>the mechanism for breaking large objects models into a
                series of pages</td></tr>

<tr><td><b>significant digits</b>:  </td>
            <td>the digits required to represent the accuracy of an
                approximate number, beginning with the leftmost non-zero
                digit and ending with the rightmost digit
                </td></tr>

<tr><td><b>simplex</b>:  </td>
            <td>a term applied to data transmission in which data can only
                sent, and not received
                </td></tr>

<tr><td><b>slotted ring</b>:  </td>
            <td>a LAN in which the computers are linked in a ring structure
                and data is transmitted in small, fixed-sized packets from
                node to node around the ring</td></tr>

<tr><td><b>socket address</b>:  </td>
            <td>a communication identifier that consists of a local port
                number and an Internet address</td></tr>

<tr><td><b>specialization</b>:  </td>
            <td>the creation of subclasses from a superclass by refining the
                superclass</td></tr>

<tr><td><b>state</b>:  </td>
            <td>the values of the attributes and links of an object at a
                particular time</td></tr>

<tr><td><b>state diagram</b>:  </td>
            <td>a directed graph in which nodes represent system states and arcs represent
		transitions between states</td></tr>

<tr><td><b>stateless server</b>:  </td>
            <td>a server that can tolerate crashes by not holding information on
		  behalf of particular clients</td></tr>

<tr><td><b>stream</b>:  </td>
            <td>a source or destination of data that may be associated with a piece
                of hardware</td></tr>

<tr><td><b>strict two-phase locking</b>:  </td>
            <td>two-phase locking in which all locks are held until the current
		  transaction commits or aborts</td></tr>

<tr><td><b>stub procedure</b>:  </td>
            <td>a procedure that converts a local procedure call to a remote procedure
                call</td></tr>

<tr><td><b>subsystem</b>:  </td>
            <td>a major component of a system organized around some coherent theme.
		A system may be divided into subsystems using either partitions or
		layers.</td></tr>

<tr><td><b>synchronous</b>:  </td>
            <td>impacting the flow of control</td></tr>

<tr><td><b>synchronous communication</b>:  </td>
            <td>a form of communication in which the sending and receiving processes
                synchronize at every message</td></tr>

<tr><td><b>system</b>:  </td>
            <td>an organized collection of components that interact</td></tr>

<tr><td><b>system design</b>:  </td>
            <td>the first stage of design, during which high-level decisions are made about the
		overall structure of the system, its architecture, and the strategies used to
		implement the system</td></tr>

<tr><td><b>system development life cycle</b>:  </td>
            <td>the process of creating a hardware/software system from its conception, through
		analysis, design, implementation, testing, and maintenance.</td></tr>
