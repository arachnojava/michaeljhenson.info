<tr><td><b>call stream</b>:  </td>
            <td>a communication facility that combines synchronous and asynchronous RPCs
                so that the different forms of communication are invisible to servers</td></tr>

                object or link</td></tr>

            <td>the first bit in the PSW register; a dual-purpose flag that
                signifies whether there is a carry-over during arithmetic,
                and is also used as a Boolean accumulator;
                </td></tr>

            <td>Common Gateway Interface -- 
                conventions for data communication
                between a Web server and an auxiliary
                program;
                <br>
                Computer Generated Image -- a physical

                graphic</td></tr>

<tr><td><b>checked exception</b>:  </td>
            <td>an exception checked by the compiler which requires a
                programmer to write explicit exception handlers</td></tr>

            <td>the process of writing data items to a recovery file along with status entries
		  and intentions lists</td></tr>

<tr><td><b>class</b>:  </td>
            <td>the definition of an object's attributes and
                operations;<br> a "blueprint" for a group of 
                objects with common attributes, operations, and
                semantics</td></tr>

<tr><td><b>class attribute</b>:  </td>
            <td>an attribute whose value is common to a class of objects rather than a value
		peculiar to each instance</td></tr>

<tr><td><b>classification</b>:  </td>
            <td>a grouping of objects with the same data structure and behavior</td></tr>

<tr><td><b>client</b>:  </td>
            <td>hardware or software that utilizes services provided by other
		  hardware or software</td></tr>

<tr><td><b>client module</b>:  </td>

                directory service under a single API</td></tr>

            <td>a group of servers in which the members execute all requests immediately
		  after receiving them</td></tr>

            <td>a measure of how well a class' members work together toward a single responsibility</td></tr>

<tr><td><b>collection</b>:  </td>
            <td>an object that encapsulates a data 
                structure for storing other
                objects</td></tr>

<tr><td><b>communication identifier</b>:  </td>
            <td>the main part of a resolved name that generally identifies the sender
                or receiver of some communication</td></tr>

<tr><td><b>complete class</b>:  </td>
            <td>a class which contains no abstract parts</td></tr>

<tr><td><b>computer science</b>:  </td>
            <td>the study of algorithms, including their formal and
                mathematical properties, hardware realizations, linguistic
                realizations, and applications; the science of algorithmic
                problem solving</td></tr>

            <td>a situation in which multiple processes exist in a single system</td></tr>

<tr><td><b>concurrency transparency</b>:  </td>
            <td>a type of transparency that enables several processes to operate
                concurrently using shared information objects without interference
                between them</td></tr>

<tr><td><b>concurrent</b>:  </td>
            <td>two or more tasks, activities, or events whose execution may overlap in

            <td>a Boolean function of object values valid over an interval of time</td></tr>

<tr><td><b>connection-oriented</b>:  </td>
            <td>a communication model in which a "virtual connection" is set up between

                a stream of data</td></tr>

<tr><td><b>connectionless</b>:  </td>
