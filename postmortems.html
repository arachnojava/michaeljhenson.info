					<h1>Postmortems</h1>
					<p><b>When this page is complete</b>, it might include details on projects from my past that I may or may
					not ever pick back up again, such as:</p>
					<hr>
					<p><b>The Blackburn Adventure</b><br>
						A detective story featuring real people, real places, and a completely fictional (and impossible)
						story.  My friends at Blackburn were all highly unique and entertaining, so we wrote a mystery
						story that takes place on Blackburn College campus and features the school's population as it was
						in 1995.  The game was never finished due to the time constraints we faced as students, but I put as
						much time as I could into it, and in its final form, the campus map was available and the player 
						character could walk around and enter buildings.  The game was being written in C, and ASCII
						graphics were used in place of bitmap tiles.
					</p>
					<hr>
					<p><b>Gravity Grave</b><br>
						A vehicular action game written in BASIC.  You play a crewmember on a starship sent to explore an
						alien planet.  The planet's gravity was inexplicably stronger than expected, and it pulls the ship apart.
						You escape in a rover vehicle that parachutes safely to the planet's surface, and now you must explore the
						planet, find the ship's missing parts, and escape.  Each part you pick up attaches to your vehicle and 
						gives you a new ability which you can use to reach new areas and/or defeat the hostile alien creatures
						you encounter along the way.
					</p>
					<hr>
					<p><b>Invasion</b><br>
						This is a screen saver that I originally did as a school project in a software engineering 
						class I took at Blackburn.  The original <i>Invasion</i> (written in C with the Borland 
						Graphics Interface) was just animated parachuting smiley faces, with no interactive elements.
						<i>Invasion 2.0</i> (in C++ with DirectX) had a feature that allowed the user to right-click and
						bring up a HUD so they could shoot down the smileys, complete with funny, mostly home-brewed 
						sound effects.
					</p>
					<hr>
					<p><b>MazeRunner</b><br>
						<i>MazeRunner</i> wasn't really a game for humans to play.  In fact, it was more of a game for the computer to
						play.  It was actually a project I did for Dr. Marsha Meredith's AI class that used genetic algorithms to
						solve mazes.  I created three or four mazes for it, but the program (written in C) could only solve one of them successfully,
						and even then, it couldn't solve it every time.  But even though it wasn't as intelligent as I'd hoped, it was
						very, very fun to watch the little virtual organisms run around, evolve...and eventually die.
					</p>
					<hr>
					<p><b>Mystic Blade</b><br>
						Stick figures and GW-BASIC graphics primitives created the simplest and most boring-looking side-scroller
						ever!  The story was OK -- a young boy named Johann gets a toy sword for his birthday and he treasures it, so he 
						leaves it next to his bed when he goes to sleep.  When a loud and unfamiliar sound wakes him from his sleep,
						he finds that the sword had turned real and his entire world has been replaced by a surreal, alien universe
						which he must navigate to find his way home.  The player could run, jump, and swing his sword, but the game
						consisted only of an opening story sequence and one playable screen that pitted Johann against a "blob" monster
						-- actually, just a primitive green circle that could grow and shrink, and die with a cheesy line/star animation.
					</p>
					<hr>
					<p><b>On the Jabberwocky's Trail</b><br>
						A menu-driven text adventure based on an improvised story written by my friend Nick when we were kids.  It was
						written in BASIC (the only language I knew at the time), and really amounts to little more than a
						"choose-your-own-adventure" story with different colored text to represent the dialog and environments.
					</p>
					<hr>
					<p><b>Super Ollie</b><br>
						A side-scrolling skateboarding game with stick figures and orthogonal background graphics written
						in good old BASIC.  Well, the first game screen was, anyway.  That's when the project was abandoned
						because it was just taking WAY too long to program all the graphics in real-time.  But the design was
						fairly complete -- puzzles, storyboards, characters, dialog, and levels were designed in comprehensive
						detail, long before I knew anything about game or level design theory.  If I'd had any formal software
						development training prior, the tech design may have been equally complete...but I hadn't, and it wasn't.
