                <p>Friends of our beloved CornShark, I come bearing news:  The absolute best version of the game to date is
                now available for download.  Right now.  Right this millisecond.  <a href="download.html">Go get it!</a></p>
                
                <p>Now, I know you're gonna say, "Yeah, we've heard this before."  But this time it really <i>is</i> the very best version ever, and without
                going into the mind-numbing technical details, I'll tell ya why:</p>
                
                <ul>
                	<li><b>The balance has been adjusted.</b>  Now there are no wasted points.  I'm sure you've all faced the irritation and disappointment 
                    that happens when you're only four points from leveling up, you eat a Whalemelon, and only get the four points needed to level up.  All 
                    the other points get wasted.  Well, not anymore.  Now if there are any points in excess of what is needed to level up, those points get 
                    applied to the next level.  (You're welcome.)</li>
                    <li><b>The game has been upgraded to use the new MHFramework 2.0 engine.</b>  What does that mean?  Without
                    going into technical details, it means the software under the hood runs a lot smoother, has fewer lags, doesn't spew
                    hideous error messages all over the console screen, and behaves equally well in both windowed and full-screen modes.</li>
                </ul>

                <p>Greetings, CornShark fans!</p>
                <p>If you're like me, there's nothing you'd rather do on Super Bowl Sunday than lock yourself away and play video games.  You're in luck, my friends,
                because right now, Super Bowl Weekend, there is a new version of <i>CornShark</i> available for download.  It has all the fish-munching
                action you've grown to love, plus the following improvements:</p>
                <ul>
                	<li><b>A higher-contrast background texture</b> for people with dim monitors.  <i>(So stop whining about not seeing any movement, will ya?)</i>  Seriously, I want your opinion on it.  I kinda like it, Michelle doesn't, so <a href="http://www.michaeljhenson.info/contact.html">tell me what you think</a>.</li>
                    <li><b>No more bonus for eating large fish.</b>  The bonus didn't help that much anyway.  However, there is still the point adjustment for beating up on smaller fish.  I think it seems fair and balanced now.</li>
                    <li><b>Fixed the bug that happened when there was a lot of biting onscreen.</b>  Now the CornShark stands a fighting chance even when he's overwhelmed in &quot;school&quot;.  <i>(Get it?)</i></li>
                    <li><b>Fixed the fish hook bug</b> where the hook icon was appearing even when another fish ate the bait.</li>
                    <li><b>Difficulty adjustment on the Easy skill level.</b>  The game is attracting quite a number of young fans, and the game is just too difficult for some of them.  So now when you choose the Easy level on the Options Screen, the CornShark has a 50% stronger bite and the other fish have a 25% weaker one.  Also, the fishing line on the bait is more easily visible.</li>
                    <li><b>Minor performance optimizations on collision processing system.</b>  Simpler logic and fewer unnecessary operations.</li>
                </ul>

				<p>
                After nearly half a year of not touching it, I finally got a chance to return to the project!  I didn't exactly dive back in headfirst.  I actually took my time to analyze the code and re-evaluate how things were being done.  One major benefit of doing so was the discovery of several optimizations that could, and certainly should, be done.  I cleaned up a few things while I was in there -- simple things that didn't require a full engineering effort.  I also fixed a serious bug that happened when there was too much biting going on at once.  (I may have introduced another bug in the process, so I won't be releasing a new version for download until I make sure it's OK.)  </p>
                <p>It may have been small progress, but any progress is better than none.  I plan to do a little something with it every week, at least once a week.</p>

                    <p>This past week hasn't been the most productive one as far as the <i>CornShark</i> project goes, but
                    nevertheless, something wonderful has happened to it.  Here is all that was accomplished this week, and
                    then an important announcement follows.

                        <li>The game timer has been implemented.  This is a central feature of the game, and it's done!</li>

    <p>What's been going on with the <i>CornShark</i> project these days?  Plenty!  The Peebee Jellyfish, the Sherbet Crab, 
                    the fishing boat, and the Sea Chicken have all reached a state of being "good enough" for alpha.  They may not be
                    100% complete, but they're alpha worthy.

                                       to be calling it an Alpha at this point.  Specifically, the missing features are:

    <td valign="top">06/06/2008               <p>First of all, an appreciative shout-out to my testers!  I know some of you feel
                                       like you haven't done anything since very few problems were discovered, but
                                       you've still done the job.  So <i><b>thank you, thank you, thank you!</b></i></p>

                                    <p>Now, after a number of delays (one being that my laptop bit the big one; another being
                                       that early versions of Windows Vista are unforgivable pieces of garbage),
                                       the <i>CornShark</i> project has once again started crawling along, and now
                                       Alpha 2 is under development.  If my volunteer testers don't find any major
                                       defects in this version, then I'll consider the Alpha phase to be successfully
                                       completed.  And then it's on to the Beta, where things get MUCH more exciting!</p>
		      <p>Here are my responses to some of the comments that were made during testing.
                                    Please forgive me for paraphrasing and/or summarizing in some cases.</p>

                                               I might fix this, but I'm not really
                                               that concerned about it.  Powerups are plentiful, so you can always grab

<p>That's right.  The coolest game character since Mario* is getting closer to greeting the public with his corny yet charismatic grin.  And you, my dear friends, are among the first to be offered this once-in-a-lifetime** opportunity to take part in shaping the final product.</p>


<p>In case y'all are wonderin'...an Alpha version is one that contains all of the core gameplay features, while still lacking various elements of its content.  For this game, that means:

<ul>
   <li>The player has all of his abilities.  He can swim in all directions, attack his prey, get bit, gain and lose levels, and die.</li>
   <li>Some animations are in place, but not most of them, and some need a little tweaking.</li>
   <li>The power-ups are all implemented.</li>
   <li>The game options are all working.</li>
   <li>Several basic AI behaviors are present, though they're not perfect by any means.</li>
   <li>There are placeholders for the sound and music, but not the sounds or songs that will be used in the final version.</li>
</ul>
</p>

<p>The next phase of the project is the Beta phase, which will include:
<ul>
    <li>Several more character types.  (For a complete list of what's to come, visit <a href="http://www.michaeljhenson.info/cornshark.html">http://www.michaeljhenson.info/cornshark.html</a>.)***</li>
   <li>A lot more animation</li>
   <li>The actual sound and music made specifically for this game (thanks to Michelle and Kevin for helping there!)</li>
   <li>A title screen, credits, shameless plugs, and so on.</li>
   <li>More important testing, 'cause it'll identify the final required tasks.</li>
</ul>

</p>
<hr width="30%" />
<b>Footnotes:</b>

<p>
* Shut up.  You don't know that it won't happen.<br />
** Yes, I meant "once in a lifetime."  The next call for testers will be for the beta -- an entirely different "once-in-a-lifetime" opportunity.<br />
*** But for goodness' sake, people, use Firefox!  Internet Explorer sucks noodles and doesn't display PNG files correctly.  Makes my whole site look even stupider than it really is.

    <td>02/04/2008<p>Being snowed in at home this past weekend had some serious advantages...</p>

<p><b><i>CornShark</i> is now playable!</b>  In this case, "playable" means you can swim around the game world and munch on (and get munched by) the few fish that are currently in the game. You can also take damage, earn points, level up, and die (though not necessarily in that order).</p>

<p>The Crackerfishy and the Rainbow Slush Trout are completed in their entirety. The base image of the Pearahna is also swimming around in there, but it's neither finished nor animated yet. All of the player behaviors and abilities are working, and the user interface is complete aside from a power-up timer.

<p>Here are the tasks remaining for the Alpha version.  Thankfully, most of them are small.
<ul>
    <li>The skill level system needs to be refactored and the affected classes updated.</li>
    <li>Endgame conditions must be checked and acknowledged.  Right now, the game just keeps going when it should be over.</li>
    <li>Power-ups must be implemented.  Not necessarily the graphic designs, but the functionality at least.</li>
    <li>The hunting, fleeing, and attacking AI behaviors need to be present in some basic form.  The fish sometimes appear to be moving intelligently now, but it's all random and coincidental.</li>
    <li>Basic sound and music need to be added, mostly for testing purposes at this point.  I'll probably just grab some random sound and MIDI files to fill in until I can turn my attention to those tasks.</li>
</ul>

<p>Then it's on to the Beta version, where I finish all the fish designs, special effects, sounds, scenery animations, play balancing, etc, etc.</p>

    <td>01/28/2008<p>I had a VERY productive day with on the almighty <i>CornShark</i> project yesterday.  I finished the Pause menu, added more animation sequences to the CornShark (biting and diving down), made swimming animations for the Crackerfishy, and dropped about twenty Crackerfishies into the game world just for the fun of it.</p>

<p>So that's the first AI character I'm doing.  Once his basic behaviors are down, it should be a fairly simple matter to create most of the others in the same (or similar) ways.</p>
